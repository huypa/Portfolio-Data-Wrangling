# Text Data Wrangling & Pre-processing Project
In project, me and my groupmate focused on extracting, cleaning, and transforming semi-structured text data into structured formats suitable for database design and downstream NLP tasks. It involved multiple stages of data wrangling, regular expression–based parsing, and text pre-processing for feature engineering.
## Key Contributions:

### Parsing Raw Text from XML text file (Task 1):

- Extracted trademark assignment records from semi-structured text files (XML) using Python (re, json, pandas).

- Designed and applied regular expressions to capture complex attributes (e.g., reel/frame numbers, assignors/assignees, legal entity descriptions).

- Normalised date formats (YYYY-MM-DD) and handled missing/ambiguous values through systematic assumptions.

- Converted the processed data into structured JSON output following strict schema requirements.

### Text Pre-processing from Youtube comments(Task 2):

- Imported and combined YouTube comments across multiple worksheets in Excel, ensuring removal of duplicates.

- Extracted and cleaned the comment data (textOriginal field) includes: handled emoji removal, lower-casing, and language detection (using langdetect).

- Constructed a vocabulary of unigrams and bigrams via tokenisation, stemming (Porter Stemmer) with careful orders consideration.

- Generated sparse numerical representations (count vectors) for each channel to prepare for NLP and machine learning applications.

- Produced deliverables including channel comment statistics (.csv), meaningful vocabulary lists (.txt), and sparse representations (.txt).

### Skills & Tools Used:

- Python (Regex, Pandas, JSON, NLTK, Langdetect)

- Text Wrangling & Cleaning (emoji removal, stemming, stopword filtering)

- Feature Engineering (unigrams, bigrams, count vectors)

- Data Transformation (JSON structuring, CSV exports)

- Collaborative Workflow (Colab, Git version history, documentation)

### Outcome:
Achieved a total score of 99/100 by marker for transforming raw semi-structured text into clean datasets ready for database integration and NLP modelling, strengthening my skills in end-to-end text preprocessing pipelines.
